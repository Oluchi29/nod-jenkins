ERROR: permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock: Get "http://%2Fvar%2Frun%2Fdocker.sock/_ping": dial unix /var/run/docker.sock: connect: permission denied

SOLUTION
on vscode ssh to your ec2 instance jenkins server and run the following commands

newgrp docker

 #is used to grant full read, write, and execute permissions to all users for the Docker socket file, which allows unrestricted access to the Docker daemon # and is a significant security risk.

sudo chmod 777 /var/run/docker.sock
